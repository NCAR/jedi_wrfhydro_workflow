# Expirement Setup
There are two YAML files required to run the workflow: `jedi_workflow.yaml` and a YAML file for the chosen JEDI method.
The workflow and Jedi will read these documents to configure the experiment.

## YAML Files
### `jedi_workflow.yaml` file
This is the base yaml that will be passed to `jedi_workflow.py` at runtime.
For more information on this document see [the documentation](jedi_workflow_yaml.md "jedi workflow yaml doc")

### `jedi.yaml` file
This section is to be expanded upon.

## JSON Files
There are four JSON files that are used by WRF-Hydro during runtime. This section is to be expanded upon.
